Introduction
============

This is an open source code to calculate the higher order elastic constants(HOECs) from first principles.

Features
------------
The software is design for post processing the elastic stiffness matrix, it has several feathers, which are listed as follows:
a. For 3D materials in any symmetry, supporting the elastic anisotropy of bulk modulus, Young's modulus, shear modulus, Poisson's ratio and hardness in 3D;
b. For 2D materials in any symmetry, supporting the elastic anisotropy of Young's modulus, shear modulus and Poisson's ratio;
c. Supporting *.xlsx, *.xls, *.txt, *.dat and *.mat data format;
d. Supporting Voigt-Reuss-Hill approximation to average the elastic modulus;
e. Supply some useful tools for 3D figures, such as slice and view point;
f. Supporting *.tif, *.jpg, *.emf, *.eps, *pdf, *.fig figure format;
g. Supporting Windows and Linux system;
h. It will give some tips for errors(Marked in red in the bottom of the GUI).
