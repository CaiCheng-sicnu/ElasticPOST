To use this code, you can set the folder containing the whole scripts as current path or install it.

To install the package, there are two different ways. 
The first method is copying the package to the destination folder you want to install, 
and then adding the folder to the variable of matlabpath.

The other way is to run the following script(Note:you need to run the MATLAB as administrator)
EPOST_INSTALL
or
EPOST_INSTALL('destination folder')
