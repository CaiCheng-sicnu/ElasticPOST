## PLEASE CITE

Mingqing Liao, Yong Liu, Nan Qu e.t. al. ElasticPOST: A Matlab Toolbox for Post-processing of Elastic Anisotropy with Graphic User Interface. *submitted to computer physics communication* (2019)

## FUNCTIONS

ElasticPOST is an open source academic free software
It is design for post processing of the elastic stiffness matrix

## FEATHERS
1. For 3D materials in any symmetry, supporting the elastic anisotropy of bulk modulus, Young's modulus, shear modulus, Poisson's ratio and hardness in 3D;
2. For 2D materials in any symmetry, supporting the elastic anisotropy of Young's modulus, shear modulus and Poisson's ratio;
3. Supporting *.xlsx, *.xls, *.txt, *.dat and *.mat data format;
4. Supporting Voigt-Reuss-Hill approximation to average the elastic modulus;
5. Supply some useful tools for 3D figures, such as slice and view point;
6. Supporting *.tif, *.jpg, *.emf, *.eps, *pdf, *.fig figure format;
7. Supporting Windows and Linux system;
8. It will give some tips for errors.
